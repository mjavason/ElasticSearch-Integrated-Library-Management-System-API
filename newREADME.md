# Library-Management-System
Simple express and typescript based API for the management and classification of books. Built to demonstrate the benefits of database indexing.

## Main Scripts

1. **Build**

   - Command: `npm run build`
   - Use this script to build the project, which is the initial step in setting up the API.

2. **Start**

   - Command: `npm run start`
   - Once the project is built, use this command to start the API for production use.

3. **Development Mode**

   - Command: `npm run dev`
   - This script is ideal for development as it enables live-reloading and other helpful tools for debugging and testing.

4. **Unit Testing**
   - Command: `npm run test`
   - Run unit tests to ensure the reliability of the API. These tests cover a wide range of scenarios, including authentication, task management, and error handling.
